Expandable code which simulates processes in different scheduling systems and calculates data such as waiting times and turn around time to be able to analyse each scheduling algorithm.

## Current developed schedule algorithms:
* First Come First Served
* Non Pre Emptive Priority
* Pre Emptive Priority
* Round Robin
* Shortest Job First
